HEY! STOP!! THIS DOESN'T ACTUALLY WORK YET. LIKE NOT AT ALL.

The goal is to create a generic OAuth subclass for use as a single sign-on
provider with Google AppEngine (GAE) applications. It is modeled on a similar
package that I wrote for use with the Flickr Auth API:

http://github.com/straup/gae-flickrapp/tree/master

Right now, the goal is just to clone whatever Richard Crowley did for his
django-twitterauth package:

http://github.com/rcrowley/django-twitterauth/tree/master

Once that's all done, the whole thing *may* be ripped apart again to create a
generic DelegatedAuthApp that both gae-FlickrApp and gae-OAuthApp can use. We'll
see...
